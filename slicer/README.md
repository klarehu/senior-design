# GCODE Slicer


This folder contains all the necesary components to convert a svg file into gcode.
Current files allow for a single layer svg to be converted into gcode, but doesn't allow for a fulll .stl file to be converted into 
layers of gcode that can be rastered out or vectorized by the ink nozzle or laser head. 



###### Update: 04/23/21
It may be best to move away from custom code. 

I'd encourage you to use available 3D-printer slicer software such as Cura, Slic3r or PrusaSlicer.
